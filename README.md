               Kega Fusion is not working due to an issue with broken DMA when CD support is active in emulation

### HOW TO USE

1. Obtain source ROM.
2. Use the BPS patch file from the current release to patch your ROM. I recommend FLIPS. 
   -> https://dl.smwcentral.net/11474/floating.zip
3. Download the SoundPacks and make sure the rom and cue files have identical base-filenames (eg. game.md and game.cue)
4. Make sure all files are in the same folder
5. If using an emulator, make sure you are using the correct CD bios files!
6. Report any issues here: https://github.com/ArcadeTV/msu-md-sonic/issues
